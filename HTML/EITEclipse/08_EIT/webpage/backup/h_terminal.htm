<h3> Terminal Emulation </h3> 
<p> On this page a user can send data to and receive data from a serial device attached to the iServer. By typing a command in the white area followed by a CR, the iServer will transmit the data out the serial port and will display any responses coming in from the serial device. The response will also be placed on the large black display. For example, *SRTH is the command to get temperature, humidity, and the status for  two contact closures. The response coming back from the serial device is 22.91 for temperature, 49.64 for humidity and open status for both contact closures as shown on Terminal Emulation page.
