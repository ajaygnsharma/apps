<h3> Device Setup </h3> 
This page allows the users to configure the iServer to communicate with up to eight RS485 devices connected to the iServer’s serial port. The iServer will send the entered commands and will receive responses from those devices. The responses can be seen by clicking on the Read Device button if the Check box is checked. This page can also be used for RS232 communication; however, there can be only one RS232 device connected to the iServer and therefore only line 1 on the Device Setup page should be entered.  By clicking on the numbers from 1 to 8, the parameters for each device can be defined. On the Device Setup page device No. 1 is illustrated as an example. The Device Parameters page has the following fields:  

Device Address – Node number for the RS485 device. It can be up to 3 alphanumeric characters.

Device Name – A text field that can take up to 16 alphanumeric characters.

Device Command – The command that is sent to the serial device and can be up to 8 alphanumeric characters.

Set-Points (SP1, SP2, SP3, SP4) – These are the commands to get the set-point values from the attached serial device (primarily used with Newport instruments). They can be up to 3 alphanumeric characters.

Response Unit – A text field that is affixed to the response sent back by the serial device. It can be up to eight alphanumeric characters

Response Format – The options are Raw and Engineering formats. The default is Raw.
