  <h3> I/O Pins </h3> 
  <p>
  This configures the digital input and output pins on the iServer which includes the directions and conditions of each pin. Once Input is selected for a pin then the Output Condition for that pin will be dimmed and the Input Condition will either be High (green light) or Low (light off). The default is Output Direction and Low Condition for all the pins.

  <h3> Conditional I/O Pins </h3> 
  <p>
  Pins 1-8 must be selected as inputs and pins 9-16 must be selected as outputs for this feature to function correctly. The conditions (low or high) of the input pins (1-8) will force the output pins (9-16) to be high or low depending on which is checked.
