<h3> Read Device </h3> 
<p> After adding Device Parameters described in the Device Setup section, the Read Device option allows users to monitor the response back from the serial device. This means that we could have up to 8 lines on this page for 8 devices with 8 different responses. Device No. 1 is shown here for illustration. Any of the devices can be selected to be placed on the large black display by clicking on the Device Name. By clicking on the No. the set-points for each device can be monitored and changed if needed.  

<h3> Auto Update </h3> 
<p> 
If 0 entered, by clicking on the Auto Update button users can manually refresh the reading. A time interval (in seconds) can be entered in the box for automatic updates. The time interval can be up to 999 seconds. The default is 0.

<h3> Device Set-Points </h3> 
<p>
By clicking on the Device No. the set-point values for that device will appear. The iServer will send R01 command (see Device Parameters page) to the attached instrument (this mainly refers to Newport instruments) to get set-point 1 and the same thing applies for getting set-points 2, 3, and 4. These values can also be changed in the same window and get transmitted to the attached instrument (setting new set-points within the instrument).
