<h3> Device Query </h3>
<p> 
This option allows to send a single command to a serial device connected to the iServer and displays the response back from that serial device. If the connection is RS485, the RS485 node number must be typed before the actual command. For example, *01 is the RS485 node number 1 and the X01 is the actual command requesting temperature value. The response will then be placed in the Response box as well as the large black display on top as shown on Device Query page. The node number can be up to 3 and the command can be up to 8 alphanumeric characters.
